## Description

An update to my previous portfolio webpage. I updated the page with my email, links to my Project Money Flagz, as well as links to some of my other homeworks from the bootcamp. I updated the CSS layout of the page to give it better functionality than it had before, and to look better when viewed on a small screen. I updated the information on my GitHub page, my LinkedIn page, and my resume to reflect my current information.
